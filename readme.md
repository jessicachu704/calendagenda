## General info
This project was created in BCIT Computer System Technology 
Fall Term 1 by Group31 for Projects 1 course. </br>
We found it hard to check the course outline for every course, many steps were needed, so we designed a web app to centralize all course information together including office hours, weight of each assignment/quiz, and the calender of the dates of dues/exams for students.
</br>
Students can also input the marks of each quiz/assignment and its weight to keep track of the course average.
